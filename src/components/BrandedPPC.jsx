        It refers to a digital marketing strategy where advertisers bid on
        keywords or search terms directly related to their own brand or
        brand-related terms. In this context, "branded" refers to the specific
        brand name or trademark of the advertiser. Here's how Branded PPC
        typically works:
      </p>
      <h4 className="font-semibold">Keyword Bidding:</h4>
      <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          We bid on keywords that are directly associated with their brand.
          These keywords often include the brand name itself, variations of the
          brand name, or specific product names.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="font-semibold">Ad Creation:</h4>
      <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          We create targeted ads specifically for the brand. These ads typically
          highlight the brand's unique selling points, products, or any current
          promotions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="font-semibold">Search Engine Placement:</h4>
      <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          When users enter the branded keywords in a search engine, our branded
          PPC ads have the potential to appear prominently in the search
          results, often at the top or side of the page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="font-semibold">Cost-Per-Click (CPC) Model:</h4>
      <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          We pay a certain amount each time a user clicks on the branded PPC ad.
          The cost is based on the bidding system, where we compete for ad
          placement.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="font-semibold">Brand Protection:</h4>
      <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Branded PPC helps in protecting the brand's online presence by
          ensuring that, when users search for the brand, they are more likely
          to see the official brand ad at the top of the search results.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="font-semibold">Targeted Messaging:</h4>
      <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          We have control over the messaging in our branded PPC ads, allowing us
          to communicate specific messages or promotions directly to users
          actively searching for the brand.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 className="font-semibold">Competitive Advantage:</h4>
      <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          By bidding on the brand terms, we can maintain a competitive advantage
          by ensuring that the official messaging is visible when users are
          actively looking for information about the brand.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Branded PPC is a strategic approach to online advertising that focuses
        on leveraging the strength of a brand's name to drive targeted traffic
        and protect the brand's online presence. It is particularly effective
        for brand recognition, customer retention & acquisition, and maintaining
        control over the messaging associated with the brand in the digital
        landscape.
